Debugging steps for monthly comparison error:

1. In monthly-comparison.html, add before fetch:
   console.log("Customer ID from localStorage:", customerId);

2. In TransactionService.java, update getMonthlyComparison method to add logging:
   try {
       // existing code
   } catch (Exception e) {
       System.err.println("Error in getMonthlyComparison: " + e.getMessage());
       throw e;
   }

3. In browser dev tools, check network tab for the API request to /api/transaction/monthly-comparison/{customerId}:
   - Check response status and body.
   - Check console for any errors.

4. Verify customerId is set in localStorage before loading monthly-comparison.html.

5. Confirm backend server is running and accessible.

Please perform these steps and share any error messages or logs you find for further assistance.
